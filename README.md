# Material Design Navigation Drawer

App sample about how to implement the [Navigation Drawer following the Material Design guidelines](https://goo.gl/qpKNsR).
This implementation is older that the [Design Support Library](http://goo.gl/GgLTjB) so does NOT use it. 
For an implementation using the [Navigation View](https://goo.gl/XwIo9D) from the [Design Support Library](http://goo.gl/GgLTjB) check out [this branch](https://goo.gl/861g0S)
